# Context Files

This folder provides a concise, AI- and developer-friendly source of truth for the Mood Tracker project.

## Files

- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` — Product purpose, stack, and key feature expectations.
- `ARCHITECTURE_CONTEXT.md` — Frontend/backend topology, data flow, and key boundaries.
- `OPERATIONS_CONTEXT.md` — Local dev, deployment, troubleshooting, and change checklists.
- `SECURITY_CONTEXT.md` — Encryption model, auth model, and security guardrails.
- `AI_SESSION_CONTEXT.md` — High-signal implementation rules for coding agents.

## How to use

- Read `AI_SESSION_CONTEXT.md` first when starting a coding session.
- Use `SECURITY_CONTEXT.md` before touching auth, data, or logs.
- Use `OPERATIONS_CONTEXT.md` for deploy/run/debug tasks.
- Keep these files aligned with real code and infra changes.
